# Since these can be recreated by running a build command (like `npm install`),
# they should not be committed to the repository.

# This section ignores files and directories created by various code editors and operating systems.
# These files are specific to a developer's local environment and should not be shared
# across different machines or collaborators.

# extensions to other developers working on the same project.
